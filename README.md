# Rutherford Scattering Simulation

## Description

This project was completed in participation of the Eton College Computational Physics Prize 2022. Inspired by the Geiger-Marsden gold foil experiment which started in 1908, this project aims to simulate the scattering of alpha particles when fired at gold atoms, and to reproduce the results obtained in the original experiment. This repository contains the fully-documented code for the project.
